The solution is that the chess board is represented as a bipartite graph,
where are 8-8 nodes. All nodes from one side are connected to all the others on the other side.
In this way we have 64 edges. Each edge between two nodes preresents a position on the chess board.
Meaning second node from the top on the left, is conneted to the fifth node on the right represents
the second row and the fifth column, (2,5) coordinates on the chess board.
A hole is represented as such that, there is no edge between that particular row and column there.
If there is a hole one the first row and the third columns' position (1,3), that means that there is no edge,
between those two nodes, the first on the left and the third on the right.
The matching of the rook is done by calculating the maximum flow, maximum matching on the bipartite graph.
The edges which are used in the matching represent the position where a rook is put on the chessboard.
Any possible maximum matching represents a state of rooks on the chessboard.
The algorithm has a complexity of O(E * f) where f is the maximum flow and E is the number of edges.
If we want all possible matching it has a factorial complexity.
