For this problem, to obtain the minimum cut with the smallest amount of edges, the capacity of the edges.
Have to be increased in G' in order to find the cut with the smallest number of edges.
The capacity of the edges in G' will be c' = c * (|E|+1) + 1 where, c is the capacity in G( the original),
|E| is the number of edges. In this way if a cut is present in G' it will be also a cut in G.
In this way the old max flow f will be f' = f * (|E| + 1) + k, k is the number of edges crossing that cut.
Given this if we consider any other cut in the original graph G, the capacity of which should be higher by 1 or more,
it will mean that, that cut's capacity will be bigger than the min cut in G' so any cut in the original graph that 
isn't a minimum cut won't be a minimum cut in the transformed graph G', either. It's supposed only to break ties between 
paths with equal augmenting capacity. Also a minimum cut in the graph G' will be a cut in G that it will have the smallest amount of edges.
