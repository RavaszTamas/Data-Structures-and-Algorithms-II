For this problem we can consider a bipartite graph, where on the left we have each resource as a vertex and
on the right each project as a vertex. Vertex S and the resources are connected having c(i) as capacity, the same way the projects are connected
with the vertex t with capacity of r(i). Each resource which is related to a project is also connected with that project,
with a capacity of infinity. Then we look for the maximul flow. After we have the maximum flow we can find the minimum cut.
This minimum cut will represent the chosen resources and projects, if it is in the set where we also have the vertex s the source,
the others which are in the set with t are not chosen. From the chosen projects, resources we can calculate the profit.
The minimum cut we obtain must be of finite value otherwise, we have a case where a mincut is through an infinite capacity edge, which should
not happen so a minimum cut satisfies the result.
