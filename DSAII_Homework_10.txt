For the n bit input we have n/2 gates, which perform a disjunction for two bits from the input,
every 2 bit has only one gate, and every two bit is used only once, so on the first comparison we have n/2 comaprisons,
then we take the results of those comparisons and apply this notion recursively in the end we have log2(n) levels
overall for any n.

For n = 2
